**Purpose and context:**
This page has the purpose to share my Home LAB BOM. vSphere is mainly used for the infrastructure management and hosting, but the environment has also other network components that allow better scalability using Proxmox.
This home lab was built to test applications, develop automation, test infrastructure components, design/implement network topologies. Besides vSphere it contains other software for backups and Windows and Linux machines.
