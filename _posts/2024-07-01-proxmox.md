In this part of my Home Lab I use Proxmox and its SDN (Software Defined Network) package. This is also a Home Lab more focused in infrastructure services, and I use it to understand better network, storage and compute (using less powerful resources). With these two components I can scale more at the network level, beyond the VLANs limitations. The idea is to provide a multi-tenant environment, where duplicated address space can coexist without affecting any of the tenants.
