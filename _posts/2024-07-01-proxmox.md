In this part of my Home Lab I use Proxmox and its SDN (Software Defined Network) package. This is also a Home Lab more focused in infrastructure services, and I use it to understand better network, storage and compute (using less powerful resources). With these two components I can scale more at the network level, beyond the VLANs limitations. The idea is to provide a multi-tenant environment, where duplicated address space can coexist without affecting any of the tenants.

At this time, I only use local attached storage, supported by a nvme disk. I setup this environment, with the help a VyOS routers (R1 and R2) and a Pfsense as a perimeter firewall for internet access. A description and an image of this setup are below (I will refer R1 and R2 as the routers).
